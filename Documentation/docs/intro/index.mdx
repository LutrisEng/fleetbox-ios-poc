# Getting Started with Fleetbox

<blockquote>
  This documentation assumes you are a part of the Fleetbox Private Beta. To
  request to join the Fleetbox Private Beta, send an email to{" "}
  <MailtoLink
    address="beta@fleetbox.io"
    properties={{
      subject: "Request to join",
      body: multiLineToSingleLine(`
        Hi there, Fleetbox team! I'd like to join the Fleetbox Private Beta. I
        currently use (a spreadsheet/CarFax Car Care/something else) to keep
        track of my vehicles, but using Fleetbox would help me (keep track of
        modifications/track my mileage/something else) better than my previous
        solution can.
      `),
    }}
  />
  . Let us know how you currently track your vehicles' maintenance log(s), and how
  Fleetbox would simplify that process!

## Downloading Fleetbox

After being added to the Fleetbox Private Beta, you should have received an
email from TestFlight.

<Image
  img={require("./invite.jpg")}
  alt={
    'Invite from TestFlight, with the subject line "Lutris, Inc has invited you to test Fleetbox."'
  }
/>

The "View in TestFlight" button should either:

- Take you to the App Store page for TestFlight, or
- Take you to TestFlight, if you already have it installed

Download and install TestFlight if you haven't already, then install Fleetbox
from inside TestFlight.

### Using TestFlight

#### Updates

By default, TestFlight will automatically update you to the latest version of
the Fleetbox Private Beta. New versions are pushed out to Private Beta users as
soon as we make a change to the Fleetbox code.

#### Downgrades

Since Private Beta updates come out so soon after we make a change, major bugs
might occasionally make it through to a Private Beta build. If there's a major
bug preventing you from using Fleetbox:

1. Let us know - we can't fix a bug we don't know about!
2. Downgrade to a known-good version of Fleetbox using TestFlight using the
   "Previous Builds" function

<Image
  img={require("./previous-builds.jpg")}
  alt={
    'The top of the "Previous Builds" page, listing two previous builds of Fleetbox'
  }
/>

### Feedback

<p>
  If you have feedback, whether that be a bug report, feature request, or
  anything else, you can either send an email to{" "}
  <MailtoLink
    address="beta@fleetbox.io"
    properties={{
      subject: "Feedback",
      body: multiLineToSingleLine(`
        Hi there, Fleetbox team! I have some feedback about Fleetbox. (XYZ is
        broken/It would be cool if XYZ existed/Competitor A does XYZ, but I
        can't figure out how to do that in Fleetbox/etc)
      `),
    }}
  />{" "}
  or send feedback through TestFlight. With TestFlight, you are also able to
  send a screenshot to let us know exactly what you're giving feedback on.
</p>

<Image
  img={require("./testflight-feedback.jpg")}
  alt={multiLineToSingleLine(`
    The TestFlight feedback screen, explaining that feedback submitted through
    TestFlight includes both your feedback and your device information, and will
    be linked with your email address.
  `)}
/>

If you're a bit more technically inclined, you can also submit bug reports and
feature requests to our
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/LutrisEng/fleetbox/issues). That issue
tracker also contains prioritization for existing bugs and features, and bug
reports and feature requests submitted through other channels typically
eventually trickle down to the GitHub issue tracker.

## First Launch

<p>
  Currently, Fleetbox just dumps you into a blank vehicle list on your first
  launch. We'll eventually have a first-launch tutorial to guide through your
  first vehicle (tracked in <GitHubIssue issue={20} />
  ), but that isn't ready yet. For now, this tutorial will have to suffice.

### Adding Your Vehicle

For this tutorial, I'll be filling out information for a fictional 2018 Toyota
Corolla, with the fictional VIN `5YFBURHEXJP000000`.

Start off by adding your first vehicle using the "Add" (+) button at the top of
your screen. This will bring you to your vehicle's details screen.

<Image
  img={require("./new-vehicle.png")}
  alt={'Fleetbox showing a new vehicle, with the title "Unknown Vehicle"'}
/>

Under the "Details" section, fill in whatever information you know about the
vehicle. For the name, you can give your vehicle whatever nickname you want! For
most vehicles, Fleetbox is able to automatically fill in the year, make, and
model using the VIN. After entering your VIN, a button will appear on the right
side of the VIN field. Press that button, and Fleetbox will try to decode your
VIN into a year, make, and model.

<Image
  img={require("./vin-decoded.png")}
  alt="A dialog bog indicating that decoding a VIN was successful"
/>

### Taking an Odometer Reading

Once you have your vehicle's details filled out, it's time to take your first
odometer reading! There are two methods, through the "Odometer" menu and through
a shortcut. For now, let's go with the shortcut so we don't overcomplicate
anything. At the top of your screen, there should be a button with "123"
surrounded by a rounded rectangle. Pressing that button takes you to the "New
Odometer Reading" screen.

<Image
  img={require("./new-odometer-reading.png")}
  alt={
    'A screen showing a form field for "Current reading" and with a title of "Odometer reading"'
  }
/>

Hop in your car and check what the odometer currently reads, and enter that
reading into the "Current reading" field on this "New Odometer Reading screen."
Once you're done, press the "Save" button in the top right corner of your
screen, and you should be brought back to your vehicle's screen. If you look at
the "Break-in period" and "Odometer" sections, they should now be updated with
your new odometer reading!

<Image
  img={require("./after-saving-odometer-reading.png")}
  alt="Fleetbox showing our fictional Corolla, with the break-in period showing as complete and the odometer showing as about 10,000 miles"
/>

It's a good idea to take an odometer reading every now and then so that Fleetbox
has an accurate estimate for how many miles are on your vehicle's odometer at
any given time.

### Adding an Image

To add a bit of flair to your vehicle's record, you can add an image. Simply
press "Add image," and Fleetbox will prompt you to select an image from your
Camera Roll.

<Image
  img={require("./added-image.png")}
  alt="Fleetbox showing our fictional Corolla with a new snazzy image"
/>

This image is also used in your vehicle list to better differentiate vehicles
from each other.

<Image
  img={require("./image-in-list.png")}
  alt="Our fictional Corolla in the vehicles list with a new snazzy image"
/>

To change the image, just tap it and Fleetbox will prompt you to choose a new
image. You can also remove the image entirely by pressing the red "X" in the top
right corner of the image.
